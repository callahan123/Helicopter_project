Using Arduino Uno::
Website
Needs the ability to: 

Find location(G.P.S. system)
Send live footage and flight data over to control center(long range wifi; limited to 30 dbm(1 watt)transmitter, 36 dbi EIRP): Look here for info: https://hak5.org/episodes/hak5-1515
Identify it’s yaw, roll and pitch(Gyro system)
Identify speed of vehicle(G.P.S.)
Identify which direction it’s pointing at(compass)
Identify which position the rotor shaft is at(G.P.S. / compass)
Identify altitude and altitude change(G.P.S system)
Have a rotating tail motor that can change yaw

Choices: 

G.P.S system: https://www.adafruit.com/products/746: 20 milli-a 
Arduino Uno: Website 50 milli-a
Data transfer system: Use Dad’s phone’s 4g to communicate with controller, then branch data out to all operators. 
For bluetooth connection to phone or operator: https://www.adafruit.com/products/2479: 29.4 milli-a
Magnetometer/compass(2 of them, calculations are for 2): https://www.adafruit.com/products/1746 100 micro-a

Rotor angle modifier motor:  https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9065 180ma x 5
Wings: 3d print flat blades with curved ends to maximize efficiency
Battery: Identify a battery that has enough capacity and low weight, based on the other components
Battery: http://limefuelstore.com/products/usb-external-battery-pack-aluminum-20000mah-5v-2-1a-blast-l200x-pro.html 20 AMP HOURS
1.619 amps worst case scenario 
About 10 hours of operations WORST CASE SCENARIO
MAXIMIZE EFFICIENCY OF ALL COMPONENTS WITHOUT LOWERING PERFORMANCE
