4/30/16: 
Identify all components to use
Identify which ports to connect to which port on the uno. Try to connect it to UNO via modular cable. The cable can connect to the connector via solder.
6/30/16:
Finished coding all 3 apps, with only 1 language of app for each 1. 
	Arduino: C++
	Android: C++(if needed, download non ANDROID IDE)
	PC:C++, maybe use other languages in coordination with it to get job done for graphics
7/31/16:
Have a physical draft of the design finished and have it fit all componentry, THEORETICALLY
8/7/16:
Revise the draft and refine it
8/14/16:
Have a CAD design of the draft 
8/16/16:
Have a physical, printed out version of the refined draft
8/20/16:
Test the frame, then if there are any noticed improvements, add them to the CAD file
8/31/16:
Have printed version of new frame
9/7/16:
Test new frame, if there are there any major improvements that need be made, re-design and re-print
9/16/16:
If there are no improvements, that’s the final copy!
10/1/16:
Make any and all code enhancements/efficiency improvements
You’re all FINISHED!
