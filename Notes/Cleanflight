On April the 27th, 2016, the use of the Cleanflight open-source code project was proposed and dismissed. The Cleanflight project
is designed for use with CERTAIN flight controllers, and since we are not using a flight controller but rather the arduino uno
with project-specific code to allow it to have the same functionality as a flight controller for this project, the Cleanflight 
project will not be an effecive solution for our programming needs. Instead, we will make our own libraries and combine them in
our program.
