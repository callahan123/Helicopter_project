Maybe, we could use solar panels so that we can boost our battery life on a single charge. That is a possibility. Will check price
on that implementation.
Ok, did some searching for a solar panel. We could use this:

It's about $5, is really small, and maybe 4 or 5 of these could charge the battery with the system under full load.


CAllahan:
i dont think its worth it cause 
its not just the solar panel you have to get a 2 set of ac to dc converts which is about 35 for a set of four and the point is to make it function on a high level but also keeping it simple adding all this stuff is cool but its not practical for what we are doing with the heli cause if you buy 2 to 3 battires that can range from 2-5 hours of life which is more then enofe.
