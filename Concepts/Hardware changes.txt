CAllahan:
i dont think its worth it cause 
its not just the solar panel you have to get a 2 set of ac to dc converts which is about 35 for a set of four and the point is to make it function on a high level but also keeping it simple adding all this stuff is cool but its not practical for what we are doing with the heli cause if you buy 2 to 3 battires that can range from 2-5 hours of life which is more then enofe.
Oh, I see.  Thanks,  didn't see that
