Maybe, we could use solar panels so that we can boost our battery life on a single charge. That is a possibility. Will check price
on that implementation.
Ok, did some searching for a solar panel. We could use this:

It's about $5, is really small, and maybe 4 or 5 of these could charge the battery with the system under full load.
